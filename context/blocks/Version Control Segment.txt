This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “Version Control Segment” is defined as follows:
<Description>
The Version Control Segment Block provides standardized version control for frequently updated documents by tracking author information, version numbers, and change descriptions. This Block serves as a simple yet essential component for maintaining document history and communicating updates to consumers, whether they are internal engineers or external users. Producers of this Block, typically authors of regularly updated documentation, will find it straightforward to implement with minimal friction, requiring only basic inputs like their name/pseudonym, the current version number, and a brief description of recent changes. The Block's unique elements focus on version tracking and change documentation, distinguishing it from a basic Author Block through its additional versioning features. It commonly appears as a subcomponent in various document types, particularly in Runbook Procedure - Standard Entries. Producers should expect a virtually frictionless experience when implementing this Block, with the only consideration being the appropriate author identification format based on the document's audience. The entire process of adding this Block to a document should take no more than a few minutes, making it an efficient tool for maintaining document version history.

*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>
<namespace></namespace>
<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>

2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions or Block Requests in the aKit (Augmentation Kit) where appropriate or necessary, especially if they are already available. the aKit informs and augments the resulting Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the cKit (Context Kit) in the way you would like them addressed. The cKit provides the necessary context to produce the Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:
<ProbeBlockRequest><sequenceID>cKit-abe40c68</sequenceID>
<kit>cKit</kit>
<question>Is a pen name/pseudonym required for author anonymity in this document? If so, which of the author's pen name(s) is most relevant to the document's intended audience?</question>
<answer></answer>
</ProbeBlockRequest>
<ProbeBlockRequest><sequenceID>aKit-abe75b62</sequenceID>
<kit>aKit</kit>
<question>Should consumers of this document have author contact information? If so, what appropriate author contact information should be included? (email, phone number, institute affiliations?)</question>
<answer></answer>
</ProbeBlockRequest>
<ProbeBlockRequest><sequenceID>qKit-abef34bb</sequenceID>
<kit>qKit</kit>
<question>Who was the last author to update this document?</question>
<answer></answer>
</ProbeBlockRequest>
<ProbeBlockRequest><sequenceID>qKit-abef3886</sequenceID>
<kit>qKit</kit>
<question>In a few words, what were the significant updates made to this document?</question>
<answer></answer>
</ProbeBlockRequest>
<ProbeBlockRequest><sequenceID>qKit-abef3580</sequenceID>
<kit>qKit</kit>
<question>When was this document last updated? Provide the date.</question>
<answer></answer>
</ProbeBlockRequest>
<ProbeBlockRequest><sequenceID>qKit-abef3b8d</sequenceID>
<kit>qKit</kit>
<question>What is the current version number for this document? (Be sure to update version following style requirements)</question>
<answer></answer>
</ProbeBlockRequest>

4. Now, draft a Document, according to the following general procedure which:
correctly implements the ontology defined in the oKit.
is informed by, consistent with, and does not contradict the information in the aKit.
is informed by, consistent with, and does not contradict the information in the cKit.
would allow a reader or consumer of the document to address all questions and block requests in the qKit
Meets all of the style requirements listed below.
