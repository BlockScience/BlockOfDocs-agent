This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “Travel Request Block” is defined as follows:
<Description>
The "Travel Request" Block streamlines the process of submitting and reviewing business travel plans by providing a standardized template for employees. Using this Block, staff members document their intended travel through a brief overview statement and supporting details in a Q&A format. The template prompts for essential information including travel dates, locations, estimated expenses, and business purpose - giving operations teams the key details needed to efficiently evaluate and process requests. This structured approach combines a high-level summary with specific logistical requirements, ensuring that employees communicate their travel needs clearly while meeting all documentation requirements. The Block's organized format facilitates quick reviews and approvals while confirming that travel requests align with organizational policies, budgets, and compliance standards. By standardizing how travel is requested and documented, the Block helps operations teams manage business travel effectively across the organization.

*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>
<namespace></namespace>
<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>

2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:
