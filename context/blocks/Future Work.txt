This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “Future Work” is defined as follows:
<Description>
The "Future Work" Block provides a focused examination of a research program's next steps and implementation roadmap, enabling reviewers to evaluate its trajectory and readiness for continued development. This Block requires researchers and project teams to articulate their planned activities, resource requirements, and potential obstacles in a structured format consisting of narrative paragraphs followed by an actionable list. By addressing specific questions about upcoming milestones, dependencies, and anticipated challenges, the Block serves as a forward-looking assessment framework, helping to identify projects that have a clear and viable path forward. The dual format of prose and bullet points challenges producers to both tell a compelling story about their project's future and break that vision down into concrete, achievable steps with consideration for potential collaborators. This systematic examination helps maintain momentum and accountability, making the proposed next phases transparent to reviewers while forcing thorough consideration of what barriers must be overcome and what capabilities must be developed for successful continuation of the research program.

*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>
<namespace></namespace>
<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>

2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:

<question>What is the purpose, mission, or primary aim of the project?</question>
