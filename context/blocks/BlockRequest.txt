This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “BlockRequest” is defined as follows:
<Description>
A BlockRequest Block is used to request the creation of a new Block within the BlocksOfDocs framework through a simple form-based process. This Block serves as a standardized way for users to initiate the development of new Blocks by providing answers to a set of predefined questions about the Block's purpose, audience, and requirements. The production process is extremely straightforward, requiring only that producers fill out and submit a form containing questions from the Block's Kit, with no additional styling or formatting needed. While some questions about existing variant or parent Blocks may require basic knowledge of the current BlocksOfDocs library, these can be skipped if uncertain and left for the admin team to address. BlockRequest's simplicity and flexibility make it an efficient tool for expanding the framework's capabilities through new Block creation requests.
</Description>

*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>
<namespace></namespace>
<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>

2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions or Block Requests in the aKit (Augmentation Kit) where appropriate or necessary, especially if they are already available. the aKit informs and augments the resulting Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the cKit (Context Kit) in the way you would like them addressed. The cKit provides the necessary context to produce the Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:
