This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “Block Definition” is defined as follows:
<Description>
The Block Definition Block facilitates the creation of clear, standardized definitions for Blocks within the BlocksOfDocs framework by guiding producers through key considerations about utility, audience, and implementation. This Block serves engineers and developers working with BlocksOfDocs by providing a structured approach to documenting new Blocks, resulting in consistent and informative definitions that help future producers understand and effectively use these Blocks. The Block requires producers to be familiar with the BlocksOfDocs framework and have a clear understanding of their block's intended utility and audience, but the actual production process is straightforward and friction-free. Producers can expect a simple implementation process, needing only to synthesize their knowledge of the block's purpose and requirements into a concise, informative paragraph.
</Description>
*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>
<namespace></namespace>
<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>
<ontology>
<namespace>Test</namespace>
<definition>This is test ontology. Remove if seen.</definition>
</ontology><ontology>
<namespace>test1</namespace>
<definition>t</definition>
</ontology>
2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions or Block Requests in the aKit (Augmentation Kit) where appropriate or necessary, especially if they are already available. the aKit informs and augments the resulting Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the cKit (Context Kit) in the way you would like them addressed. The cKit provides the necessary context to produce the Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:
