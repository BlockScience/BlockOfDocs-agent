<BlockTitle>Research Proposal Narrative</BlockTitle>
<BlockID>1ddaaeb2d006</BlockID>
This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “Research Proposal Narrative” is defined as follows:
<Description>
The “Research Proposal Narrative" Block provides a comprehensive yet focused description of a research or educational initiative proposing projects with similar requirements to a traditional National Science Foundation proposal narrative, enabling reviewers to thoroughly evaluate its merit and feasibility. It is a subvariant of the NSF - Proposal Narrative Block, and is unique in that it focuses only on the work being proposed, without consideration of audience or potential stakeholders. This Block requires principal investigators and subject matter experts to articulate their project's scientific, pedagogical, or engineering foundations, methodological approach, and anticipated impacts through a detailed narrative that demonstrates thorough planning rigor. By summarizing the basis and reason for the program alongside key aspects such as project approach, assessment methods, and broader impacts, the resulting document serves as a critical self-evaluation framework, ensuring that the team has answered key questions about the work. The typical 750-word minimum and 2000-word limit requires investigators to balance depth with conciseness, ensuring all essential components are adequately addressed while maintaining narrative coherence. This structured format helps maintain proposal quality and completeness, making the submission more compelling to reviewers while ensuring careful consideration of all elements necessary for successful project execution and meaningful impact.

*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>
<namespace></namespace>
<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>

2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions and Block Requests in the cKit (Context Kit) in the way you would like them addressed. The cKit provides the necessary context to produce the Document.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:
