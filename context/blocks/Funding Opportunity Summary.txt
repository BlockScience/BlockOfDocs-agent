This is a request to produce a Document using the “Block” defined below. A Block is a blueprint which guides the preparation, information collection, and production processes, and specifies the information and style requirements for a particular type or pattern of Document. This Block is a “Composition Block”, which will request a combination of answers to questions and requests for sub-Documents (Block Requests) that will serve as the context and components necessary to synthesize a new Document. Provided here is a definition of this Block and the Document it specifies, and step by step instructions to produce the Document. 
The Block “Funding Opportunity Summary” is defined as follows:
<Description>
A "Funding Opportunity Summary” Block is used to document and communicate the objectives, ontology, and interest areas of a funding opportunity, request for proposal, or proposal solicitation. This Block captures the key concepts, terminology, and domains of interest that define the scope of the funding opportunity. It provides a structured way to express what the funder aims to achieve, the specific language and definitions that should be used consistently throughout proposals, and the topical areas or fields that are relevant to the solicitation. The Block distills these core semantic elements into a clear format that helps all parties understand exactly what types of work the program is interested in supporting and ensures consistent interpretation of key terms and concepts across all proposal documentation.
</Description>
*Follow the step-by-step instructions below to produce the Block:*
1. Assemble the Block’s “Ontology Kit” (oKit) here by adding terms that must have correct usage throughout information collection and within the final document: If new terms appear as you complete the process, come back to add them.
<ontology>

<definition></definition>
</ontology><ontology>

2. Familiarize yourself with the Block’s “Kit” definitions below.
Address questions and Block Requests in the qKit (Query Kit) in the way you would like the Consumer to address them. The qKit defines the information requirements of the resulting Document - what questions and Block Requests should a Consumer be able to address using the resulting Document?
3. Address each Question and/or Block Request in the Block’s Kit here:
