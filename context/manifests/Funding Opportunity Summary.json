  "description": "A \"Funding Opportunity Summary\u201d Block is used to document and communicate the objectives, ontology, and interest areas of a funding opportunity, request for proposal, or proposal solicitation. This Block captures the key concepts, terminology, and domains of interest that define the scope of the funding opportunity. It provides a structured way to express what the funder aims to achieve, the specific language and definitions that should be used consistently throughout proposals, and the topical areas or fields that are relevant to the solicitation. The Block distills these core semantic elements into a clear format that helps all parties understand exactly what types of work the program is interested in supporting and ensures consistent interpretation of key terms and concepts across all proposal documentation.",
