  "description": "The \"Future Work\" Block provides a focused examination of a research program's next steps and implementation roadmap, enabling reviewers to evaluate its trajectory and readiness for continued development. This Block requires researchers and project teams to articulate their planned activities, resource requirements, and potential obstacles in a structured format consisting of narrative paragraphs followed by an actionable list. By addressing specific questions about upcoming milestones, dependencies, and anticipated challenges, the Block serves as a forward-looking assessment framework, helping to identify projects that have a clear and viable path forward. The dual format of prose and bullet points challenges producers to both tell a compelling story about their project's future and break that vision down into concrete, achievable steps with consideration for potential collaborators. This systematic examination helps maintain momentum and accountability, making the proposed next phases transparent to reviewers while forcing thorough consideration of what barriers must be overcome and what capabilities must be developed for successful continuation of the research program.",
