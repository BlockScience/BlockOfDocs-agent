  "description": "A BlockRequest Block is used to request the creation of a new Block within the BlocksOfDocs framework through a simple form-based process. This Block serves as a standardized way for users to initiate the development of new Blocks by providing answers to a set of predefined questions about the Block's purpose, audience, and requirements. The production process is extremely straightforward, requiring only that producers fill out and submit a form containing questions from the Block's Kit, with no additional styling or formatting needed. While some questions about existing variant or parent Blocks may require basic knowledge of the current BlocksOfDocs library, these can be skipped if uncertain and left for the admin team to address. BlockRequest's simplicity and flexibility make it an efficient tool for expanding the framework's capabilities through new Block creation requests.",
