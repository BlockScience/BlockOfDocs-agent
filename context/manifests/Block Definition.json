  "description": "The Block Definition Block facilitates the creation of clear, standardized definitions for Blocks within the BlocksOfDocs framework by guiding producers through key considerations about utility, audience, and implementation. This Block serves engineers and developers working with BlocksOfDocs by providing a structured approach to documenting new Blocks, resulting in consistent and informative definitions that help future producers understand and effectively use these Blocks. The Block requires producers to be familiar with the BlocksOfDocs framework and have a clear understanding of their block's intended utility and audience, but the actual production process is straightforward and friction-free. Producers can expect a simple implementation process, needing only to synthesize their knowledge of the block's purpose and requirements into a concise, informative paragraph.",
