  "block_title": "Travel Request Block",
  "description": "The \"Travel Request\" Block streamlines the process of submitting and reviewing business travel plans by providing a standardized template for employees. Using this Block, staff members document their intended travel through a brief overview statement and supporting details in a Q&A format. The template prompts for essential information including travel dates, locations, estimated expenses, and business purpose - giving operations teams the key details needed to efficiently evaluate and process requests. This structured approach combines a high-level summary with specific logistical requirements, ensuring that employees communicate their travel needs clearly while meeting all documentation requirements. The Block's organized format facilitates quick reviews and approvals while confirming that travel requests align with organizational policies, budgets, and compliance standards. By standardizing how travel is requested and documented, the Block helps operations teams manage business travel effectively across the organization.",
